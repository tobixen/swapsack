# Dash (DASH) support — design notes

Status: **Phase 0 (destination) and Phase 1 (Hold + Balance, receive-only) are
DONE** (2026-07-10). The spend side (Phase 2/3: send/sweep/swap-from/liquidity)
is **not started** — `broadcast` refuses loudly. This note records the findings
from scoping "full support for Dash" so the work is recoverable and the risky
parts are decided deliberately rather than in the middle of a money path.

## TL;DR

- **Swaps are feasible — via Maya only.** Dash is **not on THORChain** at all.
  Maya runs a live `DASH.DASH` pool (checked 2026-07-01: `Available`, depth
  ~2,291 DASH). Every Dash swap therefore routes through the Maya backend
  (`--backend maya`, or `auto`, which price-routes across backends).
- **Destination (`--to DASH`) is a small, low-risk, testable increment** — it
  mirrors LTC/DOGE/BCH: an `ASSET` entry plus a permissive `--dest` sanity
  rule. No wallet-side code, no new data source. **Do this first.**
- **The full wallet side (Hold/Bal/Send/Sweep/From/Liq) is a much bigger,
  riskier job than the other UTXO coins**, because Dash is a *legacy* (non-
  segwit) UTXO chain with **no Blockstream Esplora** and **no easy testnet
  path**. It needs a new legacy-UTXO adapter, generalized money-sensitive fee
  maths, and a Dash data source we must choose and trust.

## Why Dash is not "just another BTC"

The BTC adapter (`chains/btc.py`) and the coin-selection/fee maths
(`chains/coins.py`) are hardcoded to **native segwit (P2WPKH)**: bech32
addresses, `witness_type="segwit"`, and P2WPKH input/output virtual sizes
(`P2WPKH_INPUT_VB = 68`, `P2WPKH_OUTPUT_VB = 31`, `DUST_P2WPKH = 294`). Dash
has **no segwit** — it is legacy pay-to-pubkey-hash only. That means:

1. **No Dash network in bitcoinlib.** The installed bitcoinlib ships
   `bitcoin`, `litecoin`, `dogecoin` — but **not** `dash` (nor bch/zcash). A
   Dash network must be registered at runtime by adding an entry to
   `bitcoinlib.networks.NETWORK_DEFINITIONS`. Dash mainnet parameters:

   | field | value | note |
   |---|---|---|
   | `prefix_address` (P2PKH) | `4C` (76) | addresses start with `X` |
   | `prefix_address_p2sh` | `10` (16) | P2SH start with `7` |
   | `prefix_wif` | `CC` (204) | |
   | xpub / xprv | `0488B21E` / `0488ADE4` | standard BIP32 (as Trust Wallet uses; the legacy `drkp/drkv` bytes are deprecated) |
   | `bip44_cointype` | `5` | derivation `m/44'/5'/0'/0/x` |
   | segwit | **none** | legacy `p2pkh` only |

2. **Legacy derivation + script type.** Addresses derive at `m/44'/5'/0'/0/x`
   with `script_type="p2pkh"` / `encoding="base58"` (contrast BTC's
   `m/84'/0'/0'/0/x`, `p2wpkh`/bech32). The transaction must be built with
   `witness_type="legacy"`.

3. **Different fee maths.** Legacy vsizes differ from segwit: a P2PKH input is
   ~148 vbytes and a P2PKH output ~34 vbytes (vs 68/31 for P2WPKH), with no
   witness discount and a different dust threshold (~546). `coins.py`
   (`estimate_vsize`, `select_coins`, `sweep_amount`, the `P2WPKH_*`/`DUST_*`
   constants) must be **parameterized by script type**, not copy-pasted — this
   is the money-sensitive core and should stay a single, well-tested code path.

## The data-source problem (the real blocker)

The BTC adapter's entire balance / UTXO / broadcast / fee layer is
**Esplora-shaped** (`/address/{a}`, `/address/{a}/utxo`, `POST /tx`,
`/fee-estimates`). **There is no Blockstream Esplora for Dash.** So the wallet
side needs a different data source, with its own client methods. Options
scoped on 2026-07-01:

| Option | keyless | status when checked | API shape | risk |
|---|:--:|---|---|---|
| **Insight** (`insight.dash.org/insight-api`) | ✅ | up, synced 100% (height 2,497,657) | Insight/Bitcore: `GET /addr/{a}`, `GET /addr/{a}/utxo`, `POST /tx/send`, `GET /addrs/{a}/txs` | **single community-run instance** — a lone SPOF for a wallet; if it's down you can't spend, if it lies you mis-report funds |
| **Trezor Blockbook** (`dashN.trezor.io/api/v2`) | ✅ | **did not respond** at the probed hosts | Blockbook v2: `/address/{a}`, `/utxo/{a}`, `/sendtx/{hex}` | keyless + reputable operator, but availability unconfirmed; different (non-Esplora) shape |
| **Blockchair** (`api.blockchair.com/dash`) | ❌ | not probed | its own JSON; UTXO + push | needs an API key + is rate-limited; ToS |
| **Configurable `--dash-api`** | — | — | pick one shape, allow override | best for resilience: default to one, let the user point at their own node/instance; ideally **union two sources** so a stale/lying instance can't silently *shrink* the balance |

Notes:
- `estimatefee` is not available on the Insight instance (Dash Core doesn't
  expose it usefully). Dash fees are ~fixed and low; for a **swap** use Maya's
  quote `recommended_gas_rate` / `gas_rate_units`, and for a plain **send** use
  a conservative fixed rate (duffs/byte) or Maya `inbound_addresses` gas rate.
- A wallet's worst failure is silently **under-reporting** funds (see the
  balance-cache caveat in `TODO.md`). A single explorer that is behind or
  degraded can do exactly that, so the "let me decide later / configurable +
  union" path is the safest and is the current owner preference.

**Decision (2026-07-10):** configurable endpoint with **Insight as the
default** (`--dash-api` / `$SWAPSACK_DASH_API`). Re-probed before committing:
Insight was up and consistent; the Blockbook hosts (`dashN.trezor.io`) no
longer resolve in DNS; Blockchair works keyless but transiently blacklists IPs.
Unioning a second source stays a TODO for the spend side, where a lying/stale
explorer does the most damage.

## Testability caveat

Like the rest of the project's spending paths, the Dash spend side would ship
**unexercised on mainnet**: there is no widely-available Dash testnet with an
Esplora/Insight faucet path comparable to BTC testnet3 / ETH Sepolia
(`tests/test_integration_testnet.py`). Coin-selection/fee maths and the verify
gate are unit-testable offline; the actual UTXO-scan-and-broadcast loop is not,
without funded mainnet Dash. Plan units + an opt-in mainnet broadcast test
gated on a funded account/secret, mirroring the Nile TRC-20 loop.

## Recommended phasing

- **Phase 0 — destination (`--to DASH`). DONE.** Add `DASH: "DASH.DASH"` to the CLI
  asset map and a `--dest` rule to `addresses.py`
  (`re.compile(rf"^[X7]{_B58}{{24,34}}$")` — Dash P2PKH `X` / P2SH `7`, charset
  + length, **not** checksum; Maya validates the checksum). Confirm with a live
  `--backend maya`/`auto` quote that a `DASH.DASH` pool is hit and the memo
  pays the dest. Fully doable and testable today.
- **Phase 1 — Hold + Balance (read-only). DONE.** `chains/dash.py` with
  `derive_address` (`m/44'/5'`, p2pkh) and `wallet_balance` via Insight +
  `scan_account`; wired into `cmd_address`, `balance` and destination
  auto-derivation (with a loud receive-only warning). No bitcoinlib network
  registration needed after all: BIP32 derivation is network-independent, so
  the shared `chains/p2pkh.py` derives the pubkey and base58check-encodes the
  address directly (pinned to golden vectors cross-checked against three
  independent implementations; registering the network in bitcoinlib is only
  needed for Phase 2's Transaction building). The derived 0/0 address of the
  standard BIP39 test mnemonic has real on-chain history, giving the scan an
  opt-in live guard (`pytest -m network`).
- **Phase 2 — Send / Sweep.** Generalize `coins.py` for legacy (P2PKH) vsizes;
  build a legacy `build_unsigned_*` in `dash.py`; add a `verify_dash_send`
  gate (recipient + amount, no memo/witness) mirroring `verify_btc_send`. Wire
  into `cmd_send`. Add an opt-in mainnet broadcast test.
- **Phase 3 — From (swap source) + Liq.** Reuse the Phase-2 deposit path with a
  Maya vault + `=:`-memo OP_RETURN (mind Dash relay policy on OP_RETURN size);
  `build_and_verify` / `build_and_verify_deposit` against the **Maya** client;
  single-sided LP pairs with CACAO (no `auto` for LP — it's a pairing choice).
